# Retail Banking Web App - USA Edition

Retail Banking Web App - USA Edition is an out-of-the-box, configurable and themeable web app providing functionality tailored to the US market.

## Main characteristics of a Retail Banking Web App:

- **Fast Time to Market**. It allows “Adopt” customers to go to market in a couple of months, way faster than before, requiring zero or almost zero code touching.

- **Upgradability**. It allows customers to easily upgrade to newer versions of the App and/or features in the App by enabling them to make use of new features and bug fixes.

- **Flexibility to Adopt and Build**. It allows customers to choose between adopting out-of-the-box widgets and build their own.

- **Themeable**. It allows for non-developers to easily change the look & feel of the application to match the customer’s branding. Mainly, colors, shapes, fonts, borders, etc.

- **Configurable**. It allows customers to configure the application to better suit their needs without modifying code and breaking upgradability.

- **Localizable**. Allows content to be displayed in different languages, as long as changing date/time formats, currency, and so on.

- **Neo-like user experience**. It provides a user experience that can compete with neo-banks and doesn’t restrict the user experience. Adding elements like motion and animation can be easily done.
